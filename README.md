**COMPANY**: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS
**NAME**: ANJALI T
**INTERN ID**: CT08IWY       
**DOMAIN**: JAVA
**BATCH DURATION**: January 5th, 2025 to February 5th, 2025
**MENTOR NAME**: Neela Santhosh Kumar
**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**: This project is a simple Java program that demonstrates essential file handling operations, such as reading from a file, writing to a file, and modifying its content. It provides a menu-driven interface for users to perform these operations interactively. The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of Java's built-in libraries for handling text files and provide a clear understanding of file operations.
File handling is a fundamental concept in programming, and this project is designed to build familiarity with Java's java.io package and its capabilities. The program can handle operations on any text file specified by the user. It ensures ease of use and clarity, making it an excellent starting point for beginners in file handling.
Tools used:
Java Development Kit (JDK):
Version: JDK 17.
Provides the core libraries (java.io) for implementing file handling operations.
Eclipse IDE:
Used for writing, testing, and debugging the Java program.
The IDE’s integrated tools for syntax highlighting and debugging were helpful in streamlining the development process.
Text Files:
A sample text file (example.txt) was used for testing.
This file is either dynamically created by the program or pre-created in the working directory.
GitHub:
This project is version-controlled and hosted on GitHub to ensure accessibility and allow collaboration.
Libraries Used:
java.io.FileWriter and java.io.FileReader: For writing to and reading from text files.
java.io.BufferedWriter and java.io.BufferedReader: Used for efficient reading and writing operations.
java.util.Scanner: Used to capture user input interactively.
Program Features:
Write to a File:
Overwrites the content of a file with new input from the user.
If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new file.
Read from a File:
Displays the content of a file line by line.
Provides an error message if the file is not found.
Modify File Content:
Appends new data to an existing file without overwriting previous content.
Interactive Menu:
A user-friendly menu allows users to choose between file operations or exit the program.
